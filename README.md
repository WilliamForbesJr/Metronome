# Metronome
A simple and clean Metronome App to run in browser made with VanillaJS.

 - Live app can be found [HERE](https://eager-northcutt-37ed8c.netlify.com/)
 
 ## Motivation
This project was inspired from the WesBos JavaScript30 course. During this course, my goal is to make a new app every day inspired by the covered topic. While this project started as a simple exercise, I couldn't help but realize there are too many poor and ugly metronome apps online that can also be overcomplicated. For that reason, my goal is to expand a bit further on this with a suite of easy and good-looking practice tools for musicians. 

## Features
- Clean and simple UI. Allows the user to quickly update tempo on the fly.
- Slider to quickly allow user to change tempo in real-time.
 
## Screenshots
Include logo/demo screenshot etc.

## Tech used
Everything in this app is just using plain VanillaJS. I also try to follow some Material Design guidelines to help have a more pleasant UI.
#### Built Using:
- VanillaJS 
- CSS

## Installation
Local installation not necessary.

## Tests
Very brief unit tests and integration tests have been included. These will be updated as new features are added.
 
#### Testing Frameworks used:
  - Mocha 
  - Chai 
  
## How to Use:
Simply set the tempo within button or adjust slider and push the button to set tempo.
- Adjusting the slider while metronome is live will change tempo in real time.
